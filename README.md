# Guessing_game
This is a game coded in Python 3, in which the computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess it.
\n
On the first attempt, if the user's guess is within 10 of the correct number, the computer returns "WARM!", otherwise it returns "COLD!".
\n
On subsequent attempts, if the new guess is closer (farther) from the correct number than the previous guess, the computer returns "WARMER!" ("COLDER!").
